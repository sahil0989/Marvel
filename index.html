        <h2 class="text-center text-5xl font-bold left">Captain America</h2>
        <p class="text-center pt-16 pb-16 px-10 font-mono right">The journey of Captain America begins in the early
          1940s,
          when
          Steve Rogers, a frail and sickly man, is transformed into a super-soldier through a secret military
          experiment.
          Armed with enhanced strength, agility, and an unbreakable shield, Captain America becomes a symbol of American
          patriotism during World War II. <br> <br>

          Throughout the war, Captain America fights against the forces of the Nazi-led HYDRA organization, led by the
          evil Red Skull. He is aided by his best friend and fellow soldier, Bucky Barnes, who is ultimately captured
          and
          presumed dead. <br> <br>

          After the war, Captain America is frozen in ice and remains dormant for several decades until he is discovered
          by S.H.I.E.L.D. and revived in the present day. He struggles to adapt to modern society and comes into
          conflict
          with old enemies and new threats. <br> <br>

          Along the way, Captain America joins forces with other heroes, including Iron Man, Thor, and the Hulk, to form
          the Avengers. He also confronts his own internal conflicts and moral dilemmas, including the question of
          whether
          to follow orders blindly or to stand up for what is right. <br> <br>

          In the film "Captain America: The Winter Soldier," he learns that his old friend Bucky Barnes is alive and has
          been brainwashed and turned into a deadly assassin known as the Winter Soldier. Captain America sets out to
          save
          his friend and stop a conspiracy within S.H.I.E.L.D. <br> <br>

          In "Captain America: Civil War," he leads a faction of heroes who oppose government regulation of their
          actions.
          This puts him at odds with Iron Man and the rest of the Avengers, leading to a brutal fight between the two
          sides. <br> <br>

          In "Avengers: Infinity War" and "Avengers: Endgame," Captain America plays a key role in the battle against
          the
          intergalactic villain Thanos. In the final battle, he wields Thor's hammer and proves himself worthy of its
          power. After the battle, he decides to stay in the past and live out a life with Peggy Carter, the love of his
          life whom he had to leave behind during his time as a super-soldier.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center text-5xl font-bold left">Iron Man</h2>
        <p class="text-center pt-16 pb-16 px-10 font-mono right">The journey of Iron Man, also known as Tony Stark,
          begins
          with
          his rise to power as the brilliant and wealthy CEO of Stark Industries, a major defense contractor. After
          being
          kidnapped by terrorists, he creates a suit of powered armor to escape and becomes a superhero, using his
          technology and intellect to fight evil and protect the world. <br><br>

          Throughout his journey, Iron Man faces numerous challenges and battles, including confrontations with
          powerful
          villains such as Obadiah Stane, the Mandarin, and Ultron. He also forms alliances with other heroes,
          including
          Captain America and the Avengers, to face even greater threats. <br><br>

          Along the way, Iron Man grapples with personal demons, including his own mortality and the consequences of
          his
          actions. He undergoes a transformation from a reckless playboy to a more responsible and empathetic hero,
          driven
          by a sense of duty to protect the world and those he loves. <br><br>

          In the film "Iron Man 2," he grapples with his own mortality as a result of the arc reactor in his chest. In
          "Iron Man 3," he faces off against the Mandarin and deals with the psychological aftermath of the Battle of
          New
          York in "The Avengers." <br> <br>

          In "Avengers: Age of Ultron," he creates an artificial intelligence named Ultron that goes rogue and
          threatens
          the world. This forces him to confront his own arrogance and sense of responsibility, leading to a rift with
          Captain America and the other Avengers. <br><br>

          In "Captain America: Civil War," he supports government regulation of superheroes, leading to a conflict
          with
          Captain America and a split in the Avengers. He also discovers that his parents were killed by the Winter
          Soldier, leading to a personal vendetta against him. <br><br>

          In "Avengers: Infinity War" and "Avengers: Endgame," Iron Man plays a crucial role in the fight against
          Thanos,
          using his intelligence to create a weapon capable of defeating him. In the final battle, he makes the
          ultimate
          sacrifice by using the Infinity Stones to snap Thanos and his army out of existence, at the cost of his own
          life. <br><br>

          In the end, Iron Man's journey is one of growth and self-discovery, as well as sacrifice and heroism. He
          leaves
          behind a legacy as a brilliant inventor, a selfless hero, and a beloved friend and mentor to those who
          fought
          alongside him.</p>

          Romanoff,
          is one of struggle, redemption, and heroism. <br><br>

          As a former Russian spy, Black Widow has a complicated past that she struggles to reconcile with her present
          as a member of the Avengers. Throughout her journey, she grapples with her traumatic experiences and the
          guilt
          she carries from her former life as an assassin. <br><br>

          In the film "Iron Man 2," Black Widow is introduced as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent tasked with assisting Tony
          Stark.
          She demonstrates her combat skills and espionage abilities, showcasing her strength and intelligence.
          <br><br>

          In "The Avengers," she joins forces with the other superheroes to fight against Loki and the Chitauri
          invasion. She also forms a close bond with Hawkeye, another former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. <br><br>

          In "Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Black Widow teams up with Captain America to expose a conspiracy
          within S.H.I.E.L.D. and confronts her past as a former KGB agent. <br><br>

          In "Avengers: Age of Ultron," she struggles with her own identity and fears of being a monster. She also
          develops a romance with Bruce Banner, also known as the Hulk. <br><br>

          In "Captain America: Civil War," Black Widow must choose sides in the conflict between Iron Man and Captain
          America. She also confronts her own moral dilemmas and faces off against the villainous Helmut Zemo.
          <br><br>

          In "Avengers: Infinity War" and "Avengers: Endgame," Black Widow plays a crucial role in the fight against
          Thanos, leading the Avengers in their efforts to reverse his snap and save the universe. She ultimately
          sacrifices herself to obtain the Soul Stone, providing a key moment of redemption for her character.
          <br><br>

          In the upcoming film "Black Widow," we will see the origins of Natasha Romanoff as a spy and the events that
          shaped her into the hero we know. <br><br>

          In the end, Black Widow's journey is one of strength, resilience, and self-discovery. She overcomes her past
          and embraces her role as a hero, sacrificing everything to protect those she loves and to do what is right.

          of
          rebirth, growth, and sacrifice. <br><br>

          Groot is a tree-like alien from Planet X, who can only communicate with the phrase "I am Groot." He
          initially
          appears as a minor character in the Marvel Comics universe but becomes a fan favorite due to his unique
          abilities and personality. <br><br>

          In the film "Guardians of the Galaxy," Groot is one of the members of the titular team, alongside Star-Lord,
          Gamora, Drax, and Rocket Raccoon. He is introduced as a selfless protector, using his immense size and
          strength to shield his friends from harm. <br><br>

          Throughout his journey, Groot is instrumental in the team's battles against powerful villains, such as Ronan
          the Accuser and Thanos. He grows and regenerates from a small sprout to a fully-grown tree, demonstrating
          his
          unique ability to heal and regenerate. <br><br>

          In "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Groot returns as a smaller, more childlike version of himself known as
          "Baby Groot." He remains a loyal member of the team, helping to save the universe from destruction and
          forming
          a close bond with Rocket Raccoon. <br><br>

          In "Avengers: Infinity War," Groot joins the fight against Thanos, and in a heartbreaking scene, sacrifices
          himself to create the handle of Thor's new weapon, Stormbreaker. <br><br>

          In "Avengers: Endgame," Groot is resurrected alongside his fellow heroes and joins the fight against Thanos
          once again, using his strength and abilities to protect his friends and save the universe. <br><br>

          In the end, Groot's journey is one of rebirth, growth, and sacrifice. He learns the value of putting others
          before himself, embracing his role as a protector and a hero. He is a symbol of strength and resilience,
          showing that even the smallest or most unexpected beings can make a significant impact on the world.</p>

          them, becoming a skilled thief and adventurer, and eventually becomes the leader of his own team, the
          Guardians of the Galaxy. <br><br>

          who
          seeks to use his son's power to take over the universe. Peter must confront his feelings of abandonment and
